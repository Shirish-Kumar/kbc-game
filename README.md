# Introduction
A simple KBC game made in python played through a terminal. 

## What is KBC
It is also known as "Kaun Banega Crorepati" an Indian game show in which the presenter asks the contestant a question with four options. Every time the contestant picks the correct option, they move on to another question the money pot also increases in value, or the contestant can leave with the money available in the money pot. If the contestant gets the question wrong, they lose all the money.
Other features such as lifeline are available to keep the gameshow interesting.

## What is different
- Contestants have no option of leaving midway.
  - This is because repeatedly asking if you want to continue to play detracts from the gameplay in this setting
- Every question is worth only one point.
  - Since you cannot leave the game and questions are randomised it is fair to stick to a similar point system
- The only lifeline in the system is where the options changes from 4 to 2
  - Implementing other features such as phone a friend detracts from the gameplay in this setting
- There is no monetary reward there is only a scoreboard
- You can add/remove questions into the game
  - However the changes made will only be available for that game
